# Censornet PHP coding test 

## Abstract 

Create a micro-service in PHP without using a predefined framework such as Laravel, Symfony, etc. to list
entries from an SQL database table. 

You are free to use any Composer packages required to complete the task not including, as previously
mentioned, full framework bundles. 
Setup 

## Setup 

### Database 

Create a table similar to the schema defined below, using an RDBMS of your choice (note that we use
PostgreSQL here at Censornet and the following table schema is written with that in mind but any similar
package is suitable e.g. MySQL). 

```
CREATE TABLE vegetables (
"id" INT8 NOT NULL,
"name" VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
"classification" VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
"description" TEXT,
"edible" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
PRIMARY KEY ("id")
) WITH (OIDS=FALSE);
```

```
 CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "vegetable_id_key" ON "vegetables" USING BTREE ("id" "pg_catalog"."int8_ops"); 
```

```
CREATE SEQUENCE vegetable_id_seq
START WITH 1
INCREMENT BY 1
NO MINVALUE 
NO MAXVALUECACHE 1;
```

```
 ALTER TABLE vegetable_id_seq OWNER TO postgres;
```

```
 ALTER SEQUENCE vegetable_id_seq OWNED BY vegetables.id;
```

```
 ALTER TABLE ONLY vegetables ALTER COLUMN id SET DEFAULT nextval('vegetable_id_seq'::REGCLAS
```

## Script 
You are welcome to set up your script however you see fit although it is recommended that for simplicity
you stick to PSR-2 coding standards and PSR-4 for ease of autoloading. 

# The Task 

Create an application that lists the entries in the vegetables database table both by command line e.g. by
running a command similar to 

```
php index.php --list-veg
```

and by using a RESTful endpoint e.g. 
```
GET /vegetables 
```

The commandline option should output all entries in the table in a readable format on a unix commandline

- imagine it as a developer utility to ensure a service layer was functioning correctly. 

The HTTP endpoint should return well formed JSON. 
  
## Suggestions 

The following are suggestions and their implementation/usage or not will have no bearing on the outcome
of the test if suitable alternatives are used instead: 

- https://github.com/mrjgreen/phroute A simple fast router
- https://github.com/thephpleague/container A nice simple DI container
- http://sabre.io/http/ Handy HTTP library 

## Requirements 

Sufficient documentation to use the application should be provided, there is no need to generate browser

docs for the API endpoint though. A simple markdown file will suffice. 

Code should be documented where needed 

Automated tests should be included where suitable, 100% code coverage is not expected.Please use PHP7.0 or above
